1)
Node js vs Browser js
Note :  Both use same Javascript Engine.
Node js : 
executes javascript code at server side.
doesn't have a predefined window, document and location object
has global, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions needed for server side works.
require object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
everything is a module
headless.
processes request object.

Browser js :
executes javascript code at client side.
have predefined window, document and location objects.
may have an object named global, but it will be the exact one as "window".
don't have require predefined but can be included it in our app for asynchronous file loading.
processes response objects.
Moduling is not mandatory in client side.

2) 
traverse HTML tags and build the DOM tree.
process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.( inline(first priotiy) > embedded > external )
DOM combined with CSSOM to form render tree.
Run layout on the render tree to compute the exact position and size of each object.
Paint the individual nodes to the screen.

3) 
It is not necessary to use HTML,head, body tags. Most browser are are capable of converting the code into html and body tags.


4)
typeof(1) : number
typeof(1.1) : number
typeof('1.1') : string
typeof(true) : boolean
typeof(null) : object
typeof(undefined) : undefined
typeof([]) : object
typeof({}) : object
typeof(NaN) : number

5)
Prototype

The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript.
Function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible.
Every function includes prototype object by default.
special type of enumerable object to which additional properties can be attached to it which will be shared across all the instances of it's constructor function.
